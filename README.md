# PowerPC assembly

This repository contains example programs written in PowerPC assembly language, on GNU/Linux.

Programs were developed over time with Apple iBook G3 700 MHz and/or Apple Mac Mini G4 1.25 GHz.
GNU/Linux distribution: either Ubuntu or recently Debian 7.

The current version of Debian on the iBook computer is 3.2.0-4-powerpc #1 Debian 3.2.78-1 ppc GNU/Linux.
This computer was used to push the files to GitHub.

So it should work for you if you have a similar configuration.
